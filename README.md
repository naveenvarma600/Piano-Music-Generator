This project uses LSTM model to generate PIANO music.

Keynotes:
1) Every chord is flattened into a note, so entire data will be in the form of notes.
2) <b> music21 </b> library is used for preprocessing music data
3) midi(musical instrument digital interface) format of audio has been used for music 

Training data : https://github.com/naveenvarma600/Piano-Music_Generator/tree/main/midi_songs

It may take around 10 to 15 hours to train the model, so here's the link for trained model :
